# Contributing to Project Structure Creator

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Project Structure Creator as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Update or write your own code
3. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/Meet5555/project-structure-creator/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Meet5555/project-structure-creator/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
